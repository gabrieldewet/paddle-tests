# PaddleOCR Tests

The goal of this repo is explore the potential of PaddleOCR models with ONNX Runtime. The idea is to convert the PaddleOCR models to ONNX format and run them with ONNX Runtime. Given the known memory leakages in PaddleOCR, we will also explore the performance of the models in terms of memory usage and speed.
